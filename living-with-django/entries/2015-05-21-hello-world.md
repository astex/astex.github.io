Web frameworks have come a long way. We no longer build a user interface on the server; we build a data interface. We no longer need to depend on clunky server-side templates; we can use client-side frameworks. We no longer need to limit ourselves to single-use SQL wrappers; we can instead use object relational mapping to represent any SQL as objects.

[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) bucks these trends at every turn. The low-level documentation is so sparse and the features so bloated that you have to fight the framework to produce scalable code. I would never recommend Django for a new project ([Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) + [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is better in every way). But you can get stuck with.

I started working with [FoodtoEat](http://www.foodtoeat.com/) a year ago. We use Django. This is a blog about how Iâ€™ve tolerated that.
